# Threat Modelling

## Terminologies

* Threat
* Vulnerability
* Exploit
* Risk

## What is Threat Modeling?

* Threat modeling is an in-depth approach for analyzing the security of an application 
* It allows the reviewer to see where the entry points to the application are (i.e. the attack surfaces)
* The associated threats with each entry point (i.e. attack vectors) 
* Design and adopt various counter measures and mitigation strategies to enhance security of the application

## Objective for Threat Modeling

To gain insight to inner working of the application and its various components

## High-level Steps for Threat Modeling

1. Decompose the Application
2. Determine and rank threats
3. Determine counter measures and mitigations

## A Basic Threat Model

A basic threat model can be prepared to gain insight about a target application before fuzzing by answering questions as below:

### What are the primary assets in the application?

List what are the critical information that needs to be protected by the application and its infrastructure.

### Who are the attackers

List who are potential attackers. Example

1. Anonymous external user
2. Registered external user
3. Local user
4. Etc.

### What are the attack surfaces

Example:

1. Primary web portal
2. Support portal
3. Chat system
4. Etc.

### What are the security controls implemented in the application

Example:

1. SSL/TLS
2. Authentication
3. Authorization
4. Sandbox
5. Etc.

### How can they attack

List potential scenarios using which critical information can be breached.
