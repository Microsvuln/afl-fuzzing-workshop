# Introduction

## Intent of the Workshop

The intent of the workshop is to introduce participants familiar with vulnerability assessment and penetration testing to the art of discovering software vulnerability through static code analysis and fuzzing.

The workshop will provide a getting started experience and discussion space for anybody interested in navigating source code to identify potential attack surfaces, which in turn can be fuzzed in a targeted manner to discover potential vulnerabilities. 

Familiarity with reading C/C++ is preferred. Ability to read and understand other people's code (in any language) is highly recommended for participants.

## Objective of the Workshop

Every individual who fully participate in the workshop should be able to

1. Setup a Virtual Machine using `Vagrantfile` with an [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) fuzzing environment
2. Gain hands-on experience of various use-cases supported by [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)
3. Get started to fuzzing for discovering vulnerabiliteis
4. Perform a basic *Threat Modelling* exercise before fuzzing
5. Fuzzing of real-life open source software
